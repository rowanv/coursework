This app shows you travel destinations in the center of the city of Barcelona. There are two main sections -- the map section and the article list. The map section identifies key locations in the city by pins that are placed in the map. Each location also belongs to a location type (e.g. gyms, parks, zoos, etc.). You can filter the locations by checking and unchecking the checkboxes located above the map. This will then update the locations in real time on the map.

The article list provides you with a list of all of the locations in the center of the city of Barcelona. When you click on each of the locations, it will take you to the relevant wikipedia article, where you can then find out more. Additionally, each location has an image representation that identifies its location type.
